## Setting up Code Runner
By default, code runner uses it's own panel for showing the results after you run your python script. However, it's better to set it up in a way that it will show the resuls in the integrated terminal.

* Press `ctrl+,` to open up the settings panel
* On the search bar type `code runner terminal`
* You should be able to see an option named `Code-runner: Run In Terminal`
* Check off the option and you are good to go
