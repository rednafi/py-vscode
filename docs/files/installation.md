# Setting up VS Code on Your Machine ⚙️

## Installing VS Code

Installing VS code is easy across all operating systems.
* Just go to the link [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and select the distribution that corresponds to your OS.
* Download the file and install

## Running VS Code

* After you've completed the installation, open terminal and `cd` to your project folder. Then type:
```
$ code .
```
This will open your project in VS Code. Familiarize yourself with the GUI if you're using this for the first time. The left most stripe gives you multiple options and hovering over the icons will show you their corresponding functionalites. If you're using any third party extensions, their icons may also appear. Clicking on each of them will bring up extra actions in the succeeding column.

The default icons are (from top to bottom):
* Explorer
* Search
* Source Control (Git)
* Debug
* Extensions

## Using the Integrated Terminal

If you aren't migrating from any other terminal and haven't set up your preferred `keybindings` then you can open the integrated terminal by pressing `ctrl + ~` on your keyboard. This terminal is an exact replica of your `bash`/`zsh` terminal and can perform almost anything that you'd normally do in those. From now an on, unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, we'll be using the integrated terminal for the versatility and convenience it provides.
