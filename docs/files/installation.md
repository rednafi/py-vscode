# Setting up VS Code on Your Machine

## Installing VS Code
Installing VS code is easy across all operating systems.
* Just go to the link [here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and select the distribution that corresponds to your OS.
* Download the file and install

## Running VS Code
* After you've completed the installation, open terminal and `cd` to your project folder. Then type:
```
$ code .
```
This will open your project in VS Code.


## Using the Integrated Terminal
If you aren't migrating from any other terminal and haven't set up your preferred `keybindings` then you can open the integrated terminal by pressing `ctrl + ~` on your keyboard. This terminal is an exact replica of your `bash`/`zsh` terminal and can perform almost anything that you'd normally do in those. From now an on, unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, we'll be using the integrated terminal for the versatility and convenience it provides.
