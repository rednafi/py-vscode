# Extensions

You've already seen extensions like `themes`, `keymaps`, `code runner` etc in action. These modules can take your coding experience beyond what the built ins can offer. Here is an inexhaustive list of a few extensions that can take your python experience more optimized.

* **Code Runner:** Runs code snippet or code file of many popular languages like C, C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, **Python**, Perl, Ruby, Go, Lua, Groovy, PowerShell etc.
