How to Python with VS Code 🦄
***************************

Introduction
=====================================
Although I've been tinkering with python for my Data Science projects since 2016, I only started coding professionally at the end of 2018. It wasn't easy to get accustomed to the workflow by any means and the rigor of a production and test driven environment was something completely different from what I was used to 😓. I had only been using all the tools and packages integrated into the amazing Anaconda Packages which means Spyder as the IDE and the trusted old Jupyter Notebook for experimentation. I still use jupyter notebook, however, I've picked up **VS Code** as my primary editor not only due to the fact that everyone at my workplace uses that but also in my opinion it's one of the best language agnostic code editor, period 😁. So this post is an assortment of all the tools and practices that I've picked up throughout my development journey 🔥.

Here I'm using Linux as my primary development OS and almost all of the instructions apply to MacOS also. And About windows, 🤷‍.
